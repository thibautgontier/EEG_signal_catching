# EEG_signal_catching
C++ program to catch real-time feedback from Bitalino Electroencephalography Sensors, and turn the signal into usable inputs for a videogame

This program was made for a GameJam, and the goal was to catch and isolate as much information as possible from the EEG, to then use that input to control parts of the game.

My program can tell the user in real-time whether they are currently "calm" (experiencing lower-than-normal brain activity), "not calm", and whether they just looked to the right or to the left. (the signals we receive are different if the user looked right or left).
